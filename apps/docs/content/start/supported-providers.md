title: Supported providers
description: Current, upcoming, and planned platform targets for kubwave installs.
---

kubwave installs onto Kubernetes clusters. Provider support means the CLI knows the
right platform defaults for load balancers, storage, node selectors, and install-time
checks.

Provider selection is cluster-wide: one kubwave cluster uses exactly one provider
profile. To run kubwave on another provider, use a separate Kubernetes cluster.

## Supported today

| Provider                  | Platform ID          | Status    | Notes                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloudfleet (Hetzner)      | `cloudfleet-hetzner` | Supported | First-class target for production installs today.                                                                      |
| Cloudfleet (Google Cloud) | `cloudfleet-gcp`     | Supported | PD CSI driver installed from pinned vendored manifest (server-side apply); requires `cloud-sa` service-account secret. |

Use these targets with:

```sh
kubwave install --platform cloudfleet-hetzner
```

```sh
kubwave install --platform cloudfleet-gcp
```

Each has a step-by-step setup guide, including any GCP IAM and storage prerequisites:

- [Cloudfleet (Hetzner) setup](/providers/cloudfleet-hetzner/)
- [Cloudfleet (Google Cloud) setup](/providers/cloudfleet-gcp/)
